# Data Analyst Challenge

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing complex datasets to derive meaningful insights and demonstrate key data analytics capabilities. It includes data processing, cleaning, visualization, and summary reporting.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion and Cleaning:** Efficiently read and preprocess raw data from various sources.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Visualizations:** Generate insightful plots and charts to support data-driven conclusions.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Apply statistical methods to uncover hidden relationships.

## Project Structure
```
Data Analyst Challenge:
├── data/                # Raw and processed data files
├── Data Analyst - Challenge_Code           # Jupyter Notebook for analysis
├── Cointab Data Analyst - Challenge                 # Challenge PDF which need to solved.

```

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd data-analyst-challenge
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Key Functions
- **data_loader()**: Loads raw data into a structured format.
- **clean_data()**: Cleans the data by handling missing values and duplicates.
- **visualize_data()**: Generates various plots for exploratory analysis.
- **summarize_data()**: Provides summary statistics and key insights.

## Analysis Summary
The project analyzes the given dataset to:
- Understand challenge and dataset provided, Find out the relation between data .
- understand the distribution of key variables.
- Identify trends and outliers.
- Evaluate correlations between variables.
- Provide actionable insights supported by visualizations.

## Example Plots
- Distribution histograms.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Time-series plots.

## How to Use
1. Upload your data to the `data/` directory.
2. Open and run the notebook in `Data Analyst - Challenge_Code`.
3. Modify code from jupyter python file for custom analysis.
